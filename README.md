# PR Harmony

![YinYang](/src/main/resources/images/pluginIcon.png?raw=true)

Provides additional pull request workflows for your team. Most teams have processes around how they merge PRs, but there aren't mechanisms in Stash to ensure that no one accidentally merges something they shouldn't. This plugin attempts to address some of these shortcomings.

# Direct Commits

There are branch permissions in Stash, but they interfere with merge permissions. If you want to lock down a branch to prevent direct commits, you won't be able to merge unless you grant write access to said branch (which defeats the purpose of locking it down in the first place).
